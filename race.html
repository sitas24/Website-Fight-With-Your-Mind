<title>Race</title>
  <p> Racial discrimination has been established since the beginning of humankind; from Homo sapiens to Neanderthals and now from Black to White. Civiliation has since evolved from these times but there is still a stigma about different kinds of races that has not been uplifted yet.</p>
    <br> Racial discrimination involves treating someone unfairly because of personal characteristics (such as hair texture, skin color, or certain facial features.)</br>
    <p> Discrimination at Work<p>
      <p> If you have ever been passed from a job or have received less pay for the same amount of work just because of your skin tone, then you have been discriminated against. It is important to write down all the information.
        <h3><p> Write Down the Facts Immediately</h3><p>
        <ul>
        <li>The date and time of day when it occured</li>
        <li>The address and number of the people/complany</li>
        <li>The name or phyiscal appearance of the people to whom you spoke to.</li>
        <li> Everything you said or everything the other person said</li>
        <li> Contact information from any witnesses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the information written down, you could file a complaint with the head office(in your workplace) and cross check it with the company's anti-discrimination policy and review federal and state laws.</p>
