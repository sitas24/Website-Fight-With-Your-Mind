    <p> Police brutality is the intentional excessive abuse by a police officer.
      Police misconduct refers to inappropriate actions taken by police officers in connection with
      their official duties. Police misconduct can lead to a miscarriage of justice and sometimes involves discrimination.</p>
      <p></p>
    <p><h4>Here are some steps you can take:</h4>
      <p>Do understand what constitutes police misconduct
 Danger: Police can violate the rights of the citizens they encounter. Police officers have inherent authority, and officers who abuse
  this authority can cause great damage to the victims. Which va lead to false arrests, improper searches, forced confessions, harassment,
  police brutality and false imprisonment.

Some misconduct is intentional while other misconduct is a result of negligent, sloppy, and lazy police work. No matter what type of
misconduct suffered, a victim should consult with an attorney in order to discuss any necessary criminal defense or potential civil lawsuit.
<p></p>
<h4>Do know your options for reporting police misconduct</h4>

There are a few ways police victims can voice their grievances and indignation. Some  police departments have civil complaint departments that
record and investigate civilian complaints against the police.Another option for victims is to report the incident to the Internal Affairs division
 of the police department. However, these options lack the potential for awarding the victim damages or compensation.(Only by starting a lawsuit will
 a victim be able to hold the offending officer accountable while simultaneously seeking monetary compensation)
<p></p>
<h4>Do write down the details!</h4>

In any police misconduct lawsuit, the burden will be on the victim to prove the improper police actions. To that end, a victim should record the
officer’s name, precinct, badge/shield number, patrol car number and any other information that could help identify the involved police officer.
To have a better understanding of the information WRITE it down as soon as possible.
<p></p>
<h4>Do take pictures and track down video footage</h4>

Pictures and videos are one of the best means of conveying to a jury the injuries suffered as a result of police misconduct and brutality.
 Victims should try and track down all footage in order to strengthen the proofs in their case.
<p></p>
<h4>Do understand your goals</h4>

Each victim has a unique path to recovery from police misconduct. Some victims seek an apology while others want actions to be taken against the
offending officer.Victims need to think about their goals before taking an action.A lawsuits will demand monetary compensation but may not ensure
any direct consequences to the offending officer. Apologies are even harder to obtain. Therefore, victims should consult with an attorney and make
sure any civil or disciplinary actions taken are in line with the victim’s personal goals and recovery process.
